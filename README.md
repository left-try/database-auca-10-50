### Labs 1-5
* Lab 1: Basic psql Commands
* Lab 2: First SQL Query
* Lab 3: Databases
* Lab 4: Tables, Data Types and Constraints
* Lab 5: Primary Keys

Those labs are represented in .txt format which is just a copy of the stuff from the terminal. My commands and the output from them. I have used WSL Ubuntu 24 as an operating system and PostegreSQL 16.9 (latest realease though).
